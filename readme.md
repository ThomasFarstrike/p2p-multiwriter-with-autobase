# Building Collaborative P2P Applications with Hypercore

Welcome to our workshop on building collaborative, peer-to-peer applications! We're the team behind the [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org), a suite of Node.js modules for building data-intensive P2P applications.

For those of you already familiar with Hypercore, we'll be revisiting some of the basics through a new lens, and introducing a number of major changes and improvements in our v10 release (which as of today, is released as an [alpha release](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hypercore-next)). If you've never heard of Hypercore, or are unfamiliar with P2P software, we hope this workshop gives you a few "aha" moments -- it's exciting to build software without servers!

For this workshop we'll be focusing almost entirely on our newest feature: support for multiwriter collaboration. Gearing up for this major release involved some serious revamping of our core modules, so we'll be covering all those changes on the way to the final exercise: a collaborative, CLI-based, ultra-minimal-but-illustrative Reddit clone.

When you are ready start with [Problem 1](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/p2p-multiwriter-with-autobase/tree/main/problems/01) which gives an intro to Hyperswarm v3, our P2P networking stack.
